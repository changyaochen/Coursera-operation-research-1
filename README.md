Materials for the Coursera course: Operations Research (1): Models and Applications

Here we use `Python` libraries to solve the problem sets in the course. The `Python` environment is configured via `pipenv` (see the instruction for installation [here](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)). We also follow the notes [here](https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/) to set up the solvers.

In addition, we use Jupyter Notebook for most of the scripting.

If you want to use the `glpk` solver for `pulp`, make sure you have the solver installed. For MacOS, it can be done via Homebrew by running
~~~sh
brew install glpk
~~~
